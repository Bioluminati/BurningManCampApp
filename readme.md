This is a Django app which was built to facilitate the management of a Burning Man camp.  It tracks campers, budget, inventory, and work shifts on and off playa. 


Bioluminati is a 20 year old Burning Man camp with 35 campers attending each year, and 150 total members.  We have a complicated infrastructure, including a fully functional kitchen, with walls and an ice box and a grill, as well as a chill dome, and uber tents and yurts, and a bike pool.  We store everything in an 18 foot trailer in Gerlach.  All of this infrastructure requires a lot of orchestration and tracking. 
 

This CRUD webapp allows administrators to add and edit data for:

- Camp inventory
- Bicycles
- Budget 

Campers can add and edit their profiles, and sign up for meal shifts or drop their meal shifts.  

Chefs will be able to input the meal they are cooking, and will be able to see at a glance what eating restrictions they have to consider.
