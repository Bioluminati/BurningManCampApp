	<p>Bioluminati has camped on Playa for 20 consecutive years.  We offer bike decorating facilities known as Bike Mutation Station (BMS) and Pimp Your Bike.</p>
	<p>We welcome campers of all backgrounds.  >>> TK copy about values and culture.</p>
	<p>Our camp invests in shared infrastructure, including large common-area shelters, kitchen, shower, fire pit, group meals and dining area, and a pooled bikes for shared use.</p>
	<p>To make this possible, all campers are expected to sign up for work shifts, such as meal prep, BMS, setup or teardown.</p>
	<p>First-time campers must be sponsored by existing campers.  This way we ensure people joining feel welcomed and included.</p>
